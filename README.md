## Pub Crawl

I created this repository to learn about the behaviour of doubles and how they can be used with rspec. 

This is a very simple program that tracks progress through a pub crawl by recording pub names and adding them to a list of visited pubs. The associated rspec file contains different ways of testing methods in the Pubcrawl class using doubles.
